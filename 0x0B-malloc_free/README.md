For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

Automatic and dynamic allocation, malloc and free
char *create_array(unsigned int size, char c) - function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.
char *_strdup(char *str) - function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
char *str_concat(char *s1, char *s2) - function that concatenates two strings.
